    \class QCoapClient
    \brief The QCoapClient class allows the application to
    send CoAP requests and receive replies.

    \reentrant

    The QCoapClient class contains signals that get triggered when the
    reply of a sent request has arrived.

    The application can use a QCoapClient to send requests over a CoAP
    network. It provides functions for standard requests: each returns a QCoapReply object,
    to which the response data shall be delivered; this can be read when the finished()
    signal arrives.

    A simple request can be sent with:
    \code
        QCoapClient *client = new QCoapClient(this);
        connect(client, &QCoapClient::finished, this, &TestClass::slotFinished);
        client->get(QCoapRequest(Qurl("coap://coap.me/test")));
    \endcode

    \note After the request has finished, it is the responsibility of the user
    to delete the QCoapReply object at an appropriate time. Do not directly
    delete it inside the slot connected to finished(). You can use the
    deleteLater() function.

    You can also use an "observe" request. This can be used as above, or more
    conveniently with the \l{QCoapReply::notified(const QByteArray&)}{notified(const QByteArray&)}
    signal:
    \code
        QCoapRequest request = QCoapRequest(Qurl("coap://coap.me/obs"));
        CoapReply *reply = client->observe(request);
        connect(reply, &QCoapReply::notified, this, &TestClass::slotNotified);
    \endcode

    And the observation can be cancelled with:
    \code
        client->cancelObserve(reply);
    \endcode

    When a reply arrives, the QCoapClient emits a finished(QCoapReply *) signal.

    \note For a discovery request, the returned object is a QCoapDiscoveryReply.
    It can be used the same way as a QCoapReply but contains also a list of
    resources.

    \sa QCoapRequest, QCoapReply, QCoapDiscoveryReply
*/

/*!
    \fn void QCoapClient::finished(QCoapReply *reply)

    This signal is emitted along with the \l{QCoapReply::finished()} signal
    whenever a CoAP reply is finished, after either a success or an error.
    The \a reply parameter will contain a pointer to the reply that has just
    finished.

    \sa error(), QCoapReply::finished(), QCoapReply::error()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QCoapClient::error(QCoapReply *reply, QtCoap::Error error)

    This signal is emitted whenever an error occurs. The \a reply parameter
    can be null if the error is not related to a specific QCoapReply.
